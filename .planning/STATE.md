# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-09)

**Core value:** Rastrear estados de jornada de motoristas em tempo real com interface responsiva, comunicacao segura via BLE, e dados que nunca se perdem.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- NimBLE stack (not Bluedroid): smaller footprint, BLE-only, included in ESP-IDF 5.3.1
- Screen Manager with stack pattern: push/pop navigation, extends existing IScreen/IScreenManager interfaces
- Menu button in StatusBar (not swipe): avoids conflict with existing numpad/jornada swipe
- GATT-based BLE protocol: standard BLE, compatible with iOS CoreBluetooth and Android BLE API
- OTA via BLE (not Wi-Fi): device has no Wi-Fi configured, BLE already available
- Dual OTA partitions: allows rollback if OTA fails, critical for field devices

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- PSRAM migration of LVGL display buffers must happen before NimBLE is enabled (internal SRAM starvation risk)
- Partition table change is irreversible -- requires USB reflash of all existing devices
- Actual NimBLE memory footprint (~50KB estimate) must be verified empirically on hardware
